## what is it?

RISC-V is an open specification of an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). That is, it describes the way in which software talks to an underlying processor – just like the x86 ISA for Intel/AMD processors and the ARMv8 ISA for the latest and greatest ARM processors. Unlike those however, the RISC-V ISA is open so that anyone can build a processor that supports it.

## What’s the big deal?

RISC-V EcosystemFor companies supplying products to customers, lock-in is a wonderful thing. It means that once the vendor has the customer it is very hard for the customer to change to a competitor’s product. The best way to create lock-in is to have good-enough products and a rich ecosystem. That way, once you have the customer, they have invested too much into the implementation and you have them locked-in for a very long time. Any new competitor must have a better product, but also build an equivalent ecosystem. Even then it will be almost impossible for a customer to do apples-to-apples comparison based on the merits of the solution.

Just like the old saying that no one ever got fired for buying IBM, these days it is accepted that no-one ever gets fired for using ARM processors. There is a dark side to this however. If companies are not able to compete on the merit of their solutions, progress stagnates. Companies invest just enough to keep customers happy – no more, no less.

RISC-V changes this dynamic since a single software ecosystem built on the RISC-V standard supports many different processor vendors, and the processor vendors must now compete on the merit of their product for different applications. Customers don’t need to settle for good-enough, and competition will mean a significant acceleration of innovation in embedded processors. Also, without the need for each new processor startup to build an expensive ecosystem, many new innovative processor companies will appear.

## KOOMPI RISCPI

RISCPI is KOOMPI Fabless for RISC-V design and development. Our plan is to recruit a group of young talented, committed and passionate about the futue of building our RISC-V base CPU.

KOOMPI starting this project officially in October 2020.
